## About

I'm a Machine Learning and Backend Engineer at [Anghami](https://www.anghami.com/),
where I work with the machine learning team on developing and deploying recommendation 
algorithms, ranging from Collaborative Filtering to Content-based algorithms. 
Before that, I was a Computer and Communications Engineering student at the American University 
Of Beirut, where I worked on different projects ranging from cooperative media content 
distribution to computer vision using deep learning. My main interests are Machine Learning, 
Algorithms, Software Architecture and Design, and Recommender Systems.
